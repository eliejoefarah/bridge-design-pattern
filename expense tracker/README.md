## Description

The aim of the project is to simplify the process of tracking one's expenses. This is done by setting a savings value, which represents the total amount of money available, and a budget value representing the amount of money willing to be spent.

## Motivation

The project was motivated by the fact that it can sometimes be overwhelming to keep track of your spendings and earnings so having a software do that for you will facilitate that process.

## Build Status

This project has some limitations to it, it could have included a delete button for example. In addition, a yearly summary could have been done as well.

## Code Style

The object oriented programming was used through java. JavaFX also makes extensive use of OOP

## Features

After setting the mentioned amounts, various transactions, including their category - ranging from transportation, to leisure, to utilities, and so on - and the price paid.
The transactions will appear in a table with the above information, and a summary can be generated with respect to the data present.
The summary button displays a piechart, with each portion representing a category.

## How to use executable file?

We first generated a jar file and then from it an exe file that will load the app once you click on it.
